### Hey {{ first_name }}, welcome to Umpyre! Here's a ${{value}} message to get you started

We're really happy to have you on board! Here's some information to help you
get the most out of Umpyre.

## Notes to get you started

* Umpyre is about making sure everyone has skin in the game. There's a cost for
  someone to get your attention, so they have to make sure it's worth it.
* We recommend you [go to your profile](/profile) and fill it out. Add a photo,
  choose a handle, and write a description telling people who you are.
  Your profile is public!
* You can send a message to anyone on the platform. Type their name into
  the recipients field when you compose a message, and you can search the
  network. The reading level of that person will be displayed when you select
  them from the menu.
* Reading level (or RAL) is a measurement of what someone's attention costs,
  based on the value of messages they've read. If you want to be at the top of
  someone's inbox and trigger a notification (provided they have notifications
  enabled), make sure you price your messages at or above their RAL.
* Messages are always end-to-end encrypted, and they're stored on the client
  side only. In other words: we can't read your messages, and we don't hang on
  to your messages 30 days. Everything is deleted from our servers.
* We don't retain any behaviourial data that includes personally identifiable
  information, either about you or the contents of your messages. For
  example, we don't read your messages so we can target you with ads (there
  are no ads!).
* We retain account and payment information to combat fraud, maintain a high
  quality network without spam or bot accounts, and to comply with
  regulations where necessary.

## Pro Tips(tm)

* Messages can be formatted using markdown
* Email notifications are enabled by default only for messages at or above your
  RAL. Check [your account preferences](/account) if you want to change this.
* Got an open source project? [Grab your badge from your profile](/profile):
  place the badge in your project's README so people can contact you.
* Umpyre is open source! [Here's our GitHub page](https://github.com/umpyre-code/).

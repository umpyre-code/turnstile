## Notes to get you started

- On Umpyre everyone has skin in the game. There's a cost to get someone's
  attention, so make sure it's worthwhile.
- We recommend you [go to your profile](/profile) and fill it out. Add a photo,
  choose a handle, and write a description telling people who you are.
  Your profile is public!
- You can send a message to anyone on the platform. Type their name into
  the recipients field when you compose a message, and you can search the
  network. The reading level of that person will be displayed when you select
  them from the menu.
- Reading level (or RAL) is a measurement of what someone's attention costs,
  based on the value of messages they've read. If you want to be at the top of
  someone's inbox and trigger a notification (provided they have notifications
  enabled), make sure you price your messages at or above their RAL.
- Messages are always end-to-end encrypted, and they're stored on the client
  side only. In other words: we can't read your messages, and we don't hang on
  to your messages 30 days. Everything is deleted from our servers.
- We don't retain any behaviourial data that includes personally identifiable
  information, either about you or the contents of your messages. For
  example, we don't read your messages so we can target you with ads (there
  are no ads!).
- We retain account and payment information to combat fraud, maintain a high
  quality network without spam or bot accounts, and to comply with
  regulations where necessary.

## Pro Tips(tm)

- Messages can be formatted using markdown.
- There's no way to search or find old messages. If this is something
  you're pining for, send us a note and we'll take that feedback into
  consideration. In the meantime, we suggest you copy and paste messages that
  have important content, if that's what you need to do. You can also access
  the raw data directly from your browser's storage if you feel adventurous.
- You can bump a message you've already sent by replying to your own sent
  message with additional payment.
- Email notifications are enabled by default only for messages at or above your
  RAL. Check [your account preferences](/account) if you want to change this.
- Got an open source project? [Grab your badge from your profile](/profile):
  place the badge in your project's README so people can contact you.
- Umpyre is open source! [Here's our GitHub page](https://github.com/umpyre-code/).
- [Check out our blog](https://blog.umpyre.com/) if you'd like to hear our
  thoughts, learn about new features, and understand more about the problems
  we're trying to solve with Umpyre.

### Hey {{ first_name }}, welcome to Umpyre! Here's a ${{value}} message to get you started

Umpyre is a messaging platform that helps experts monetize their expertise.
We're really happy to have you aboard, and we'd love to hear your feedback.
We want to make the platform more useful for you (see below on how to contact
us).

## Helpful notes to get you started

* We recommend you [go to your profile](/profile) and fill it out. Add a photo,
  choose a handle, and write a description telling people who you are.
  Your profile is public!
* You can send a message to anyone on the platform. Type their name into
  the recipients field when you compose a message, and it'll search the
  network. The reading level of that person will be displayed when you select
  them from the drop down.
* Reading level (or RAL) is a measurement of what it costs to get that persons
  attention. If you want to go to the top of their inbox and trigger a
  notification, make sure you price the message at or above the RAL.
* Messages are always end-to-end encrypted, and they are stored on the client
  side only. In other words, we can't read your messages, and we don't hang on
  to copies of them after 30 days. Everything is deleted from our servers.
* We don't retain any behaviourial data with personally identifiable
  information, about you or the contents of your messages.
* We retain account and payment information to combat fraud, maintain a high
  quality network without spam and bot accounts, and to comply with
  regulations where necessary.

## Pro Tips(tm)

* Messages can be formatted using markdown
* Email notifications are enabled by default only for messages at or above your
  RAL. Check [your account preferences](/account) if you want to change this.
* Got an open source project? [Grab your badge from your profile](/profile):
  place the badge in your project's README so people can contact you.
* Umpyre is open source! [Here's our GitHub page](https://github.com/umpyre-code/).
